# Getting Started with Create React App

This project, is a native app (not a proper one with platform specific programming languages) built using Capacitor as well as standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and a JS library (React.js). It serves as an experiment as well as a design implementation for a native Capacitor app for Tomislav Anic's final bachelor thesis.
